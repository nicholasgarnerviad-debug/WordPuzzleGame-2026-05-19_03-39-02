# Word Ladder

A modern, mobile-portrait word-ladder puzzle game built in **Unity 6000.4.6f1** (Unity 6 LTS), portrait **1080×1920**. Transform a start word into an end word one letter at a time — every intermediate step must be a real English word that differs from the previous word by exactly one letter.

```
FROM  C  A  T            FROM  S  T  O  N  E
       |                        S  T  O  R  E   ← changed 1
      B  A  T  ← changed 1      S  T  A  R  E   ← changed 1
      B  A  G  ← changed 1      S  H  A  R  E   ← changed 1
 TO   B  A  G            TO     S  H  A  R  P   ← changed 1
```

## Screens

> Live captures (iPhone 13 Pro Max portrait). The UI follows the dark, gold-accented "premium puzzle" identity in [§5](#5-visual-identity) / [§15](#15-design-tokens) — `accent-gold` reserved for the current focus/target.

| Screen | |
|---|---|
| **Main Menu** — gold `WORD LADDER` masthead. **DAILY** is the gold hero (primary call-to-action; shows the streak once today is solved). The three modes — **Classic Mode / Puzzle Show / Time Attack** — are the surface-tier group; **Puzzle Library / Stats** are demoted tertiary chrome (Settings now lives in the shared top-right gear). **Resume** appears only when an in-progress save exists. | <img src="docs/screenshots/main-menu.png" width="250"> |
| **Classic Mode** — the core word ladder. Anchored **start** word up top, the played **chain** (each rung a one-letter change), the **gold-edged active input row**, the anchored **target** word, then the Hint / Undo / Reveal **power-up bar** seated just above the QWERTY keyboard (red `DEL`, green `GO`). An icon **HOME** (house, top-left) and the shared **Settings** gear (top-right) flank a calm score header — both icon-only. Random 3–7-letter puzzles. | <img src="docs/screenshots/classic-mode.png" width="250"> |
| **Puzzle Show** — tier-progression play on the same gameplay screen, with a `Tier X / Y` indicator under the score. Curated ladders; clear 10 in a tier to unlock the next ([§7](#7-puzzle-show-tiers)). | <img src="docs/screenshots/puzzle-show.png" width="250"> |
| **Time Attack** — a countdown timer + the **+Time** power-up; chosen as 60s/120s × Timed/Survival on a setup screen. Solve as many ladders as possible before the clock runs out. | <img src="docs/screenshots/time-attack.png" width="250"> |
| **Puzzle Library** — browsable tier cards: **Locked** (padlock), **Unlocked**, **In Progress** (gold border), **Completed** (green check). Tap an unlocked card to play that exact puzzle. | <img src="docs/screenshots/puzzle-library.png" width="250"> |
| **Stats** — current & longest daily **streak**, dailies completed, total **coins**, total puzzles, and per-mode played/won (Classic, Time Attack best round). | <img src="docs/screenshots/stats.png" width="250"> |
| **Settings** — audio sliders (master / SFX / music), accessibility toggles (mute, reduce-motion, haptics, colorblind mode, high-contrast, large-text), **Reset Progress** (confirm-gated; preserves settings + tutorial flag), **Replay Tutorial**, and the build version. | <img src="docs/screenshots/settings.png" width="250"> |

> **Global chrome:** one shared **Settings** gear (icon-only, top-right, ~HOME-sized) shows on every screen *except* Settings itself and opens it — `UIManager.CreateGlobalSettingsButton` → `OnGlobalSettingsRequested` → `GameBootstrap.ShowSettings` (which populates then shows). On the gameplay screen a house **HOME** (top-left) and the gear (top-right) flank the header. Icon assets: `Assets/UI/Icons/*.svg` (Vector Graphics) + `Assets/Resources/Icons/*.png`.

## 1. Game modes

| Mode | Timer | Puzzles | Win condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Classic** | None | Random, BFS-generated; start/end restricted to a common-words subset | Reach the end word; next puzzle auto-loads. First-ever launch routes into the tutorial. |
| **Daily** | None | One puzzle per day, identical for every player (no server) | Reach the end word; counts toward your streak |
| **Puzzle Show** | None | Curated tier library (15 puzzles × 6 tiers = 90) | Reach end word; tap any unlocked card to play it |
| **Time Attack** | 60s or 120s, Timed or Survival | Random words back-to-back | Solve as many as possible before time runs out |

**Daily puzzle + streak** — Today's puzzle is derived from the player's **local date** with no network call: `index = (Today − 2025-01-01).Days mod N`, where `N` = pool size in `Assets/Resources/Data/daily_puzzles.json` (all entries pre-validated Hamming-1 + dictionary). Streak rules (`DailyStreakRules`, pure/testable): completing today increments `currentStreak` iff yesterday was completed; a missed day resets to 1; same-day re-completion never double-counts; `longestStreak = max(longestStreak, currentStreak)`. Persisted under `daily_v1`.

**Time Attack sub-modes** — **Timed**: fixed countdown (60s/120s), no rewards. **Survival**: each solve grants `BalanceConfig.SurvivalRewardSeconds` (15s) so a skilled player can sustain. Configured via `TimeAttackConfig` (factories `Default60`/`Default120`/`DefaultSurvival`, all read `BalanceConfig`).

**Share result** — `ResultsScreen` "Share" copies a Wordle-style emoji grid to the clipboard (`ClipboardShareService`, zero third-party deps). One row per accepted step, `🟩` at the changed position, `⬛` elsewhere; mode-specific label/footer. Native image share is seam-ready (`IShareService` + `ShareCardBuilder`) but requires an approved plugin.

---

## 2. Power-ups

| Power-up | Effect | Default budget / puzzle | Coin cost | Available in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Hint** | Gold-highlights the position in the current word to change next | `BalanceConfig.DefaultHintsPerPuzzle` = **3** | `HintCost` = 0 | All modes |
| **Reveal** | Shows the next solution word as a ghost preview row | `BalanceConfig.DefaultRevealsPerPuzzle` = **1** | `RevealCost` = 25 | All modes |
| **Undo** | Pops the last accepted chain word | n/a | `UndoCost` = 0 | All modes |
| **+Time** | Adds `AddTimeGrantSeconds` (10s); charges = 1 (60s base) / 2 (120s base) | from `TimeAttackConfig` | — | Time Attack only |

Reveal is deliberately **scarcer and pricier** than Hint (it's strictly stronger). Budgets seed in `GameStateManager.StartNewPuzzle` from `BalanceConfig`. Submitting a valid word or using Undo clears any active hint/reveal preview.

---

## 3. Economy & monetization

**Single economy:** `EconomyManager : IEconomyManager` (constructed + `InitializeAsync()` in `GameBootstrap`), persisting coins through `DataManager` → `PlayerProgress.totalCoins`. (A legacy `CoinSystem` MonoBehaviour also exists but is orphaned — see [§13](#13-known-tech-debt--candidate-tasks).)

**Faucet / sink model** (all amounts in `BalanceConfig`):

| Direction | Source / sink | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Faucet | Puzzle completion (`GrantPuzzleReward`) | `PuzzleCompletionReward` = +10 |
| 🟢 Faucet | Daily bonus (stacks) | `DailyBonusReward` = +25 |
| 🟢 Faucet | Rewarded video (opt-in) | `RewardedAdHintGrant` = +1 Hint |
| 🔴 Sink | Reveal (extra) | `RevealCost` = −25 |
| ⚪ Free baseline | Per puzzle | 3 hints + 1 reveal, regardless of balance |

**Anti-deadlock guarantee:** the free per-puzzle baseline + no fail/lives gate means a broke player can always finish; 3 completions (3×10) more than fund one Reveal (25). Power-ups accelerate, never gate — no pay-to-win.

**Ads (Google Mobile Ads, already integrated):**
- `IAdService` (in the low-dep `Puzzle` assembly so tests can mock it) → `AdService : MonoBehaviour` (real AdMob) + `NullAdService` (Editor/headless fallback).
- **Ad unit IDs are AdMob TEST IDs as `[SerializeField]` placeholders — never real IDs in source.**
- **Rewarded video is opt-in only** (`GameBootstrap.RequestRewardedHintAd` / `RequestRewardedContinue`); reward granted **exactly once** on the SDK's reward callback, **never** on dismiss/failure.
- `AdPolicyService` enforces the **interstitial frequency cap** — both a time cooldown (`InterstitialCooldownSeconds` = 300) **and** a puzzle count (`InterstitialPuzzleCap` = 5), between-session only, gated on a stubbed `AdsRemoved` flag (future "remove ads" IAP). Clock is injectable for tests.

---

## 4. Juice: motion, haptics, sound

All three feedback channels fire on the same four moments and all respect a **reduce-motion** accessibility flag.

| Moment | Animation (≤200ms ease-out) | Haptic | Sound |
|---|---|---|---|
| Letter placed | tile lock-in punch (`LetterTile.PunchScale`) | light tap | key-press |
| Word accepted | row settle + changed tile → green glow | medium tap | accept |
| Word rejected | input-row shake (skipped if reduce-motion; reason still shows) | buzz | reject |
| Puzzle won | `GameplayScreen.WinAscentBeat` (TO row gold→green, upward rise+settle, ~500ms) | buzz | win sting |

- **reduce-motion:** `SettingsData.reduceMotion` → `UIAnimations.ReduceMotion` (static, set from `GameBootstrap` on settings load/save). Every animation coroutine in `UIAnimations` and `LetterTile` snaps to the end-state and `yield break`s when true.
- **Haptics:** `IHaptics` → `HandheldHaptics(Func<bool> enabled, Action vibrate = Handheld.Vibrate)` + `NullHaptics`. `Handheld.Vibrate` is a coarse full-buzz; fine-grained haptics need a plugin (TODO, not added). Gated on `SettingsData.hapticsEnabled`. The injectable `vibrate` action makes it unit-testable.
- **Sound:** `SfxManager` (pooled `AudioSource`; clip slots assigned in-scene). No `AudioMixer`/clips in the repo yet → AudioListener-level. Pure static gate `SfxManager.EffectiveSfxVolume(SettingsData)` returns 0 when muted (testable).

---

## 5. Visual identity

Dark, gold-accented "premium puzzle" identity with a vertical ladder/ascent metaphor.
- **Gold discipline:** `accent-gold #C9B458` is reserved for the **current focus/target** — the current-input/hint tiles, the in-progress library card, the primary streak number, tutorial emphasis. Secondary chrome (TO label, tier indicator, score, "Best:", library header/badge) is demoted to `text-muted #8A93A1`.
- **Ascent:** the chain climbs toward the anchored TO row at the bottom; the win beat reinforces upward motion.
- **Motion vocabulary** (one place: `UIAnimations`): `MICRO = 0.16s` (micro-interactions), `STANDARD = 0.22s` (transitions), `EaseOutCubic`. Deliberate and weighted — no cartoon bounce.

---

## 6. First-launch tutorial

On first launch (flag `onboarding_v1` absent/incomplete), tapping **Classic** routes into a scripted tutorial instead of a random puzzle.
- Fixed ladder **CAT → BAT → BAG** (`TutorialPuzzle.Create()`), injected like the daily puzzle.
- `TutorialOverlay` — non-modal step-gated coach marks (accent-gold emphasis) with a **Skip** button at every step; advances only on intended actions; rejection reuses the existing `OnWordSubmissionResult` feedback; a short success beat then drops into the first real puzzle.
- Gating logic is pure/testable: `OnboardingRules.ShouldRouteToTutorial / MarkCompleted / Reset`. Persisted as `OnboardingData { completed, skipped }` under `onboarding_v1`.
- **Replay tutorial** in Settings clears the flag. The flag **survives Reset Progress** (only Replay clears it). If the overlay isn't wired, the gate no-ops so a player is never stranded.

---

## 7. Puzzle Show tiers

| Tier | Word length | Optimal steps | Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 2 | 15 |
| 2 | 3 | 3 | 15 |
| 3 | 4 | 2–3 | 15 |
| 4 | 4 | 4 | 15 |
| 5 | 5 | 2–3 | 15 |
| 6 | 5 | 3–4 | 15 |

Tier 1 unlocked by default. Complete **`BalanceConfig.PuzzlesRequiredToAdvanceTier` (10)** puzzles in the current tier to unlock the next; `MaxTier = 6`. Progress (`PuzzleProgressData`: completed IDs, in-progress IDs, current tier) persists under `puzzle_progress_v1`. The library renders cards as **Locked** (grey/padlock), **Unlocked/Unplayed** (neutral, FROM→TO preview), **In Progress** (gold border), **Completed** (green border + check). The authoritative tier→puzzleId map comes from `tier_definitions.json` (never hardcoded math).

---

## 8. Word validation

`WordValidator : IWordValidator` accepts a word onto the chain only if **all** hold:
1. Exists in the 8,399-word curated dictionary (`word_library.json`).
2. Differs from the previous chain word by **exactly one letter at the same position** (Hamming-1, via `WordOps.HaveOneLetterDifference`).
3. Same length as the previous word.
4. Not already used in the current chain.

Distances are computed **once per puzzle**: `WordValidator.Initialize` caches `WordGraph.ComputeDistancesFrom(target)` so `ValidateWord` does **zero BFS per submission**. `isProgress` = strictly closer to the target than the previous word.

On rejection, `GameStateManager` surfaces a user-facing reason via the `OnWordSubmissionResult` event (consumed by `GameBootstrap` → `GameplayScreen`). User strings: `"Not a real word"`, `"Already used"`, `"Change exactly one letter"`, `"Word must be N letters"`, `"Type a word"`. Rejected submissions never end the puzzle — there are **no lives**; players keep typing until they reach the end word or quit.

> Note: the validator currently returns English `Message` strings that `GameStateManager.MapValidationMessage` re-parses with `IndexOf` to pick the reason — brittle if reworded. A typed-enum refactor is a known candidate task ([§13](#13-known-tech-debt--candidate-tasks)).

---

## 9. Balance config — the single source of truth

`Assets/Scripts/Puzzle/BalanceConfig.cs` (global namespace, lowest-dependency `Puzzle` assembly so everything can read it). **All tunable numbers live here** — never reintroduce magic-number literals in consumers.

```
Power-ups:   DefaultHintsPerPuzzle=3  DefaultRevealsPerPuzzle=1
             HintCost=0  RevealCost=25  UndoCost=0
Time Attack: TimeAttackBaseSecondsShort=60  TimeAttackBaseSecondsLong=120
             AddTimeChargesShort=1  AddTimeChargesLong=2
             AddTimeGrantSeconds=10  SurvivalRewardSeconds=15
Generation:  MaxBfsDepth=10  MaxGenerationAttempts=20
             Easy/Medium/HardWordLength=3/4/5
             Easy/Medium/HardTargetDistance=2/4/6
Tiers:       MaxTier=6  PuzzlesRequiredToAdvanceTier=10
Economy:     PuzzleCompletionReward=10  DailyBonusReward=25  RewardedAdHintGrant=1
Ads:         InterstitialCooldownSeconds=300  InterstitialPuzzleCap=5
```

`Constants.cs` forwards its legacy power-up/tier fields to `BalanceConfig` to avoid drift.

**Generation quality filter:** `common_words.json` (≈1,472 verified words = every tier/daily ladder word ∪ a curated common list) restricts generated START/END (and intermediates) to fair words. Fallback chain: strict-common → relaxed-common-endpoints → known-good fallback (`cat→cot→cog→dog`). Curated tier/daily puzzles bypass the generator and are exempt.

                                           Screens/(MainMenu, Gameplay, PuzzleLibrary, Results,
                                           Settings, TimeAttackSetup)

Assets/Resources/Data/  word_library.json (8,399), tier_definitions.json (90), daily_puzzles.json, common_words.json
Assets/Scenes/          GameUI.unity  ← the ONLY live scene. MainMenu/ClassicMode/PuzzleShowMode/
                                        TimeAttackMode/SampleScene are legacy and never LoadScene'd.

Assets/Editor/          SceneBuilder*.cs + Verify* menu-item tools
```
Assembly dependency direction: `Puzzle` (lowest) ← `Persistence`/`State` ← `Modes` ← `Game`/`UI`. **`Puzzle` must never reference `State`/`UI`** (circular). Put shared low-level types in `Puzzle`.

### State flow (immutable + Dispatch — DO NOT change this shape)
`GameStateManager` owns an immutable `GameState` snapshot plus a private `MutableGameState`. UI subscribes to state; `GameAction` instances go through `Dispatch()`, which routes to handlers: `HandlePressLetter`, `HandleDeleteLetter`, `HandleSubmitWord`, `HandleUseHint`, `HandleUseReveal`, `HandleUseAddTime`, `HandleUndo`. Each handler mutates the working state, then notifies subscribers and persists. Events: `OnWordSubmissionResult` (accept/reject + reason), `OnTimeAdded` (AddTime/Survival seconds).

### Public interfaces to preserve (method names/signatures)
`IWordValidator`, `IDataManager`, `IGameMode`, `IEconomyManager`. (You may change a *return payload* if a task explicitly says so, but keep the method surface.)

### Mode routing (`GameBootstrap`)
- `Classic` → `StartClassicMode()` → tutorial gate, else random puzzle (common-words filtered).
- `Daily` → `StartDailyMode()` → today's deterministic puzzle.
- `Puzzle Show` → `PuzzleLibraryScreen`; tap → `OnLibraryPuzzleSelected(int puzzleId)`.
- `Time Attack` → `TimeAttackSetupScreen` → `StartTimeAttackModeWithConfig(TimeAttackConfig)`.
- **HOME** on any in-game screen returns to MainMenu and tears down the active mode + event subscriptions cleanly.

---

## 11. Persistence keys

All via `PlayerPrefs` (JSON values). `DataManager` owns them.

| Key | Holds | Cleared by Reset Progress? |
|---|---|---|
| `puzzle_progress_v1` | `PuzzleProgressData` (tiers, completed IDs) | ✅ yes |
| `wordpuzzle_progress` | `PlayerProgress` (coins, stats) | ✅ yes |
| `wordpuzzle_save` | in-flight `GameStateSnapshot` | ✅ yes |
| `daily_v1` | `DailyProgress` (streak) | ✅ yes |
| `settings_v1` | `SettingsData` (volumes, mute, reduceMotion, hapticsEnabled) | ❌ preserved |
| `onboarding_v1` | `OnboardingData` (tutorial done/skipped) | ❌ preserved (only Replay clears) |

`DataManager.ResetAllAsync` clears the four "yes" keys and preserves settings + onboarding. (`"Coins"` is a legacy key written only by the orphaned `CoinSystem`/`PlayerDataManager` — see [§13](#13-known-tech-debt--candidate-tasks).)

---

## 12. Testing & tooling

- **NUnit EditMode** tests under `Assets/Tests/Unit/{Engine,Persistence,UI}` and `Assets/Tests/Integration`. The `Unit.Tests` asmdef references the `Game.*` assemblies (incl. `Game.Puzzle`, `Game.UI`, `Game.Persistence`); UI-folder tests use a separate `Tests` asmdef. Most new tests need **no asmdef change**.
- **Mocks** in `Assets/Tests/TestMocks.cs`: `MockDataManager`, `MockWordValidator`, `MockEconomyManager`, `MockAdService`. Extend these rather than inventing new doubles.
- **Conventions:** pure-logic classes (e.g. `DailyStreakRules`, `OnboardingRules`, `WordOps`, `BalanceConfig`, `SfxManager.EffectiveSfxVolume`) are tested standalone; `GameStateManager` tests build it with the mocks; persistence tests use `new DataManager()` against PlayerPrefs with `[SetUp]/[TearDown]` key cleanup.
- **Run:** Window → General → Test Runner → EditMode → Run All. (See [§17](#17-notes-for-ai-agents-working-in-this-repo) for the MCP test-runner caveat.)
- **Editor tools** (`Tools/` menu): `Verify*` probes (library/ladder/polish), `SceneBuilder*` idempotent scene builders.

---

## 13. Known tech debt / candidate tasks

**Closed in the Task 9 consolidation (commit `17e6ab3`):**
1. ✅ **Orphaned managers removed** — `CoinSystem` + `PlayerDataManager` stripped from the 3 legacy scenes and deleted; one-time stale `"Coins"` key cleanup in `DataManager`.
2. ✅ **Undo collapsed to one path** — dead `GameSnapshot`/`undoHistory` stack deleted; `HandleUndo` is chain-rewind only (power-ups stay spent by design).
3. ✅ **Score + streak floored** at 0 on undo (`Mathf.Max(0, …)`).
4. ✅ **Typed reject reason** — `WordValidator` returns a `WordRejectReason` enum (in the `Puzzle` assembly); `GameStateManager` maps enum→text in one place; the `IndexOf` parser is gone. User strings unchanged.
5. ✅ **`HaveOneLetterDifference` unified** — `PuzzleGenerator` now calls `WordOps`.

**Still open:**
6. **Native image share** — `IShareService`/`ShareCardBuilder.RenderPng` seam is ready; wiring the OS share sheet needs an approved plugin (e.g. NativeShare).
7. **AudioMixer + real SFX clips** — `SfxManager` has slots but no clips/mixer in the repo yet.
8. **Full Classic resume** — Resume restores tier/daily puzzles (id-resolvable); random Classic isn't reconstructable from the current save snapshot (no end-word/solution stored), so it hides Resume. A snapshot-schema extension would enable full Classic resume.

> **Verification caveat (important for any agent):** the unityMCP EditMode test runner is currently **non-functional** — it collapses to the assembly root and never invokes NUnit, reporting `"Passed"` even for a deliberately-failing canary. Treat its summary as "not run." Verify changes by **clean compile + reading test assertions against the implementation** until the runner is fixed (see [§17](#17-notes-for-ai-agents-working-in-this-repo)).

---

## 14. Writing a master prompt for this repo

A good task prompt for this codebase has a consistent shape. Reuse it:

1. **Paste the [Shared Context Block](#shared-context-block-paste-into-every-task-prompt)** (repo layout, hard constraints, design tokens) at the top — it grounds the agent.
2. **State a single GOAL** (one concern per prompt; this repo was built one swarm per concern).
3. **`PLAN FIRST`** — require the agent to locate exact files + method seams against the real files, list assumptions where ambiguous, and *not* edit before confirming. (Critical: parts of this README may drift; the agent must verify against the tree.)
4. **Break the work into lettered sub-tasks** (e.g. `TASK 9A / 9B …`), each with concrete file/seam targets.
5. **Give explicit ACCEPTANCE criteria** — what an EditMode test must assert, what stays green, what the manual check is.
6. **Repeat the hard constraints** (immutable state + Dispatch; preserve `IWordValidator/IDataManager/IGameMode/IEconomyManager`; all tests green; delete `.meta` with assets; never commit `Library/Temp/obj`; surgical diffs).
7. **Optionally `USE SWARM`** for 3+ file / cross-module work; keep single-file fixes solo.

**Effective patterns observed:** name the exact constant in `BalanceConfig` to read; specify the testable seam (inject a `Func<>`/`Action` rather than calling `Time`/`Handheld`/SDK directly); say where in `GameBootstrap` to wire; tell the agent which existing mock to extend; and for anything visual, acknowledge the final check is a manual portrait eyeball.

text-primary #E7E1C4/#F5F7FA, text-muted #8A93A1, text-dim #5A6270.

Hard constraints (ALL prompts):
- Preserve the immutable GameState + Dispatch architecture and the public interfaces
  IWordValidator, IDataManager, IGameMode, IEconomyManager unless a task says otherwise.
- All existing EditMode/PlayMode tests stay green. Delete the .meta when you delete a Unity asset,
  and GUID-check scenes/prefabs before deleting any MonoBehaviour script.
- Never commit Library/Temp/obj. Minimal, surgical diffs.
- PLAN FIRST: confirm exact method seams against the real files before editing; state assumptions
  where ambiguous. Tunables go in BalanceConfig, never as new magic-number literals.

## 16. Building & running

**Requirements:** Unity 6000.4.6f1, TextMeshPro (bundled), Google Mobile Ads (integrated). Portrait 1080×1920; CanvasScaler matches height.

1. Clone, open the root folder via Unity Hub → *Add project from disk*.
2. Open `Assets/Scenes/GameUI.unity` and press **Play**.
3. Tests: Window → General → Test Runner → EditMode → Run All.

## 17. Notes for AI agents working in this repo

Environment quirks learned the hard way — relevant when an agent verifies its own work:
- **The unityMCP `run_tests` runner is unreliable for pass/fail.** It reports `summary.total=0`, collapses results to a single root node, and has reported `"Passed"` for a suite containing a must-fail test. Treat `"Passed"` as *compiles + discovered*, **not** runtime-green — verify by reading test-source assertions against the implementation. EditMode runs require the editor **not** in Play Mode (`manage_editor stop` first).
- **`execute_code` (in-editor C#) is broken here** (mono "filename or extension is too long"; Roslyn not installed). You cannot script Play-mode drives or screenshots — visual/feel acceptance is a human-in-Editor check.
- **`manage_camera` screenshots can't see the portrait game.** The capture returns a blank ~2:1 landscape Game-view rendered via the Main Camera (which **excludes** the Screen Space - Overlay UI canvas); the real frame is the portrait Device Simulator on display 0, which MCP can't read (`scene_view` capture needs an open Scene View). Verify UI **numerically** instead — `manage_scene get_hierarchy` with `include_transform` for positions, `ReadMcpResourceTool` on `mcpforunity://scene/gameobject/{id}/component/{name}` for rects/colors/refs — and hand the portrait eyeball to a human. Also: Play mode boots straight to **MainMenu** (you can't script into a specific mode), `manage_gameobject`/`set_property` edits are **blocked during Play**, and **instance IDs churn on every domain reload** — re-query, never cache them.
- **Confirm scene context before/after agent work.** Loading a scene in the editor replaces the open one; agents have left the editor on a non-`GameUI` scene and/or in Play mode. Re-open `GameUI.unity` and stop Play mode to restore the expected view.
- **`git status` before planning/committing.** Background agents occasionally drop shell-misfire junk files at repo root (e.g. `nul`, `{`, `0`) and can even pick up a *later* task autonomously — clean junk and check the tree before each commit.
- **Icons — SVG via Vector Graphics, or PNG.** `com.unity.vectorgraphics` provides the SVG importer; set the importer's **SVG Type = Textured Sprite** (the default "UI Toolkit" type yields *no* uGUI sprite — empty `SpriteRect`), and give artwork a **concrete stroke/fill colour, not `currentColor`** (which rasterizes to black and can't be tinted via `Image.color`). UI chrome (HOME, the global Settings gear) is built in code as tinted `Image` children. A `[SerializeField] Sprite` ref can point anywhere under `Assets/`; sprites loaded at runtime (`Resources.Load`) must sit under a `Resources/` folder.
- Untracked tooling dirs (`.claude/`, `.swarm/`, `.claude-flow/`, `agentdb.*`, `_Recovery/`) are not part of the game — never commit them. Shell-misfire junk (`nul`, `{`, `0`, `560)`, `statsScreen`, …) sometimes lands at repo root — delete before committing.

## Project history

Built iteratively through AI-orchestrated swarms, one concern each: word library & ladder semantics → modern tile/keyboard polish → library cards & tier gate → HOME/settings → hint/reveal semantics → per-mode behaviors & AddTime → TimeAttack UI → share result → daily + streak → **balance config & common-words generation** → **economy & rewarded ads** → **tactile juice (motion/haptics/sound)** → **premium visual identity (gold focus, ascent, motion vocabulary)** → **UI polish pass** (main-menu hierarchy with a gold DAILY hero, gameplay spacing, a keyboard-anchored power-up bar, a reliable visible HOME, and a properly clipping/scrolling word-chain) → **icon chrome** (SVG-via-Vector-Graphics + PNG icons: a house HOME and one shared, icon-only top-right Settings gear on every screen). The git log captures the progression.
