# Word Ladder

A modern, mobile-portrait word-ladder puzzle game built in Unity 6000.4.6f1. Transform a start word into an end word one letter at a time — every intermediate step must be a real English word that differs from the previous word by exactly one letter.

```
FROM  C  A  T            FROM  S  T  O  N  E
                                ↓
       ↓                         S  T  O  R  E
                                ↓
      B  A  T  ← changed 1       S  T  A  R  E
                                ↓
      B  A  G  ← changed 1       S  H  A  R  E
                                ↓
 TO   B  A  G            TO     S  H  A  R  P
```

## Game modes

| Mode | Timer | Puzzles | Win condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Classic** | None | Random 3–7 letter words, BFS-generated | Reach the end word; next puzzle auto-loads |
| **Daily** | None | One puzzle per day, identical for every player (no server) | Reach the end word; counts toward your streak |
| **Puzzle Show** | None | Curated tier library (15 puzzles per tier × 6 tiers = 90) | Reach end word; tap a card to play any unlocked puzzle |
| **Time Attack** | 60s or 120s, Timed or Survival | Random 3–7 letter words back-to-back | Solve as many as you can before the timer runs out |

### Share Result
- A **Share Result** button on the Results screen copies a compact, paste-anywhere summary to
  the clipboard (`GUIUtility.systemCopyBuffer`). No third-party plugin required.
- Format mirrors Wordle's emoji grid — one row per accepted chain step, `🟩` at the position that
  changed, `⬛` at unchanged positions:
  ```
  Word Ladder — Daily #123
  CAT → BAG  •  2 steps
  🟩⬛⬛
  ⬛⬛🟩
  🔥 Streak 5 · Best 12
  ```
- Mode label varies: `Classic`, `Daily #N`, `Puzzle Show T<tier>`, `Time Attack 60s [Survival]`.
- Time segment (`m:ss`) is only included for timed modes (Time Attack).
- Streak footer is only included for the Daily mode.
- **Native image share** (the OS share sheet with a PNG of the grid) requires a third-party plugin
  (e.g. [NativeShare](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare)). The seam is in place:
  `Assets/Scripts/Game/IShareService.cs` and `ShareCardBuilder.RenderPng(input)` produce the PNG.
  Adding the NativeShare package requires explicit approval; until then, the default
  `ClipboardShareService` is used.

### Daily Puzzle + Streak
- Today's puzzle is derived from the player's **local date** with no network call:
  `index = (Today − 2025-01-01).Days mod 450`. Every client on the same calendar day
  picks the same `PuzzleDefinition` from `Assets/Resources/Data/daily_puzzles.json`
  (450 entries, all pre-validated Hamming-1 + dictionary).
- **Streak rules**: completing today's daily once increments `currentStreak` if yesterday
  was also completed; a missed day resets the streak to 1; same-day re-completion never
  double-counts; `longestStreak = max(longestStreak, currentStreak)`.
- Persisted under PlayerPrefs key `daily_v1` (`DailyProgress`): last completion ISO date,
  current + longest streak, last 60 completed dates, today's flag + index.
- MainMenu shows `DAILY` (or `DAILY ✓ N` once today is done). Results screen surfaces
  `Streak: N days` in accent gold + `Best: M` + a "Come back tomorrow" line.

### Time Attack sub-modes
- **Timed**: Fixed countdown from 60s or 120s. No time rewards.
- **Survival**: Each completed puzzle adds reward seconds (+10s for the 60s base, +15s for the 120s base) so a skilled player can play forever.

## Power-ups

| Power-up | Effect | Available in |
|---|---|---|
| **Hint** | Gold-highlights the position in your current word that needs to change to reach the next solution step | All modes |
| **Reveal** | Shows the next word in the solution path as a ghosted preview row | All modes |
| **Undo** | Pops the last accepted chain word | All modes |
| **+Time** | Adds seconds to the clock: +5s (60s base, 3 charges) or +10s (120s base, 2 charges) | Time Attack only |

Each puzzle starts with a fixed budget per power-up. Submitting a valid word or using Undo clears any active Hint/Reveal preview to keep the UI honest.

## Puzzle Show tier progression

The library is organized into 6 tiers of increasing difficulty:

| Tier | Word length | Optimal steps | Puzzle count |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 letters | 2 | 15 |
| 2 | 3 letters | 3 | 15 |
| 3 | 4 letters | 2–3 | 15 |
| 4 | 4 letters | 4 | 15 |
| 5 | 5 letters | 2 | 15 |
| 6 | 5 letters | 3–4 | 15 |

Tier 1 is unlocked by default. Complete **10 puzzles in the current tier** to unlock the next tier. Progress (completed puzzle IDs, in-progress IDs, current tier) is persisted to `PlayerPrefs` under the key `puzzle_progress_v1`.

The Puzzle Library screen renders each puzzle as a level card with state:
- **Locked** — grey card, padlock affordance (higher tier)
- **Unlocked / Unplayed** — neutral card with `FROM → TO` preview and step count
- **In Progress** — gold border
- **Completed** — green border with checkmark

---

## Word validation

A submitted word is accepted onto the chain only if all of these hold:

1. Exists in the 8,399-word curated dictionary (`Assets/Resources/Data/word_library.json`).
2. Differs from the previous chain word by **exactly one letter at the same position** (Hamming-1).
3. Is the same length as the previous chain word.
4. Has not already been used in the current chain.

When a word is rejected, the screen surfaces a specific reason via `OnWordSubmissionResult`:

- "Word not in dictionary" — fails dictionary check
- "Must change exactly one letter" — fails Hamming-1
- "Word must be N letters" — wrong length (from `GameStateManager` wrapper)
- "Word already used"
- "Type a word" — empty (from `GameStateManager` wrapper)

Rejected submissions never end the puzzle. There are no "lives" — players keep typing until they reach the end word or quit.

---

## Settings

Reachable from the main menu. Persisted to `PlayerPrefs` key `settings_v1`.

- **Master volume** slider (0–100) — drives `AudioListener.volume`
- **SFX volume** slider (persisted; AudioMixer integration planned)
- **Music volume** slider (persisted)
- **Mute All** toggle — forces `AudioListener.volume` to 0
- **Reset Progress** — wipes `puzzle_progress_v1` and player progress with a confirmation modal. Settings themselves are preserved.

### State flow
`GameStateManager` owns an immutable `GameState` snapshot plus a private `MutableGameState`. UI subscribes to state changes; `GameAction` instances are dispatched through `Dispatch()` which routes to handlers (`HandleSubmitWord`, `HandleUseHint`, `HandleUseReveal`, `HandleUndo`, `HandleUseAddTime`). Each handler mutates the working state, then notifies subscribers and persists.

### Ladder UI semantics
`GameplayScreen` renders five layered row types inside the chain view:
1. **Start word row** — anchored top, FROM label
2. **Chain history rows** — each accepted word; the tile at the position that *changed from the previous row* is highlighted green (#6AAA64) using a diff-highlight algorithm
3. **Current input row** — what the player is typing. If a hint is active, the indicated tile is gold (#C9B458)
4. **Reveal preview row** — only visible when reveal is active. Outline-only tiles, except the changed-letter index in gold
5. **End word row** — anchored bottom, TO label. Turns green when the chain reaches it

Auto-scrolls 180ms ease-out after every chain mutation so the current-input row sits 8px above the end-word row.

### Mode routing
- `MainMenu → Classic` → `StartClassicMode()` → random length 3–7 puzzle
- `MainMenu → Puzzle Show` → opens `PuzzleLibraryScreen`; tapping a card calls `OnLibraryPuzzleSelected(int puzzleId)` → starts that specific puzzle
- `MainMenu → Time Attack` → opens `TimeAttackSetupScreen` (2×2 grid) → on confirm calls `StartTimeAttackModeWithConfig(TimeAttackConfig)` → starts a session
- **HOME** button on any in-game screen returns to MainMenu and tears down the active mode cleanly

## Project history

The project was built iteratively through seven AI-orchestrated swarms, each focused on a single concern. The git log captures the progression:

- `swarm-1` Word library, settings, redesign, ladder semantics
- `swarm-2/3` Modern polish: letter tiles, on-screen keyboard, hint/undo/reveal feedback
- `swarm-3` Library cards, tier gate, FROM/TO labels
- `swarm-4` Home button, badge reparenting, settings feature
- `swarm-5` Ladder hint/reveal semantics (next-word, changed-position)
- `swarm-6` Word submit bug fix, per-mode behaviors, AddTime power-up
- `swarm-7` UI completion: TimeAttackSetupScreen + AddTime button in scene

See `Assets/Screenshots/` for chronological visual snapshots.
